What Is OpenCV ?
Ans-> OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. 
This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. 
It supports the Deep Learning frameworks TensorFlow, Caffe, and PyTorch.

What is a CNN?
Ans-> A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep neural network (DNN) widely used for the purposes of image recognition and processing and NLP. 
Also known as a ConvNet, a CNN has input and output layers, and multiple hidden layers, many of which are convolutional.

Gender and Age Detection Python Project- Objective
To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

Gender and Age Detection – About the project
In this Python Project, we will use Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. We will use the models trained by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi. 
The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final softmax layer). 
It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. 
And so, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression

To go about the python project, we’ll:

Detect faces
Classify into Male/Female
Classify into one of the 8 age ranges
Put the results on the image and display it

The Dataset
For this python project, we’ll use the Adience dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it here. 
This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. 
The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. 
The models we will use have been trained on this dataset.
